The following lines list the checksum values for all score
files in this downloaded zip archive.

A "checksum" value is an error-checking mechanism that may
assist in determining whether a file has been modified or data
garbled due to transmission or faulty storage.  The "checksum A"
value uses the POSIX 2 checksum algorithm.  The "checksum B" value
uses the CCITT cyclic redundancy check algorithm.  

Note that checksum commands will differ for ASCII files formatted
in DOS/Windows style or Unix/Macintosh formatted text.  The files in
this ZIP archive were in Unix/Macintosh line formatting style when the
checksums were compiled.
